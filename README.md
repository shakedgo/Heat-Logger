# Heat-Logger

A sophisticated machine learning application that predicts optimal water heater timing based on user feedback, shower duration, and environmental factors. The system uses advanced similarity-based learning algorithms to continuously improve predictions through user feedback on a granular 1-100 satisfaction scale.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This application represents a complete implementation of a machine learning system that learns from user behavior to optimize daily routines. The core innovation lies in the **Target-Based Prediction Algorithm** that calculates optimal heating times by analyzing historical data patterns rather than making incremental adjustments.

## ✨ Key Features

### Advanced Machine Learning System
- **Target-Based Prediction**: Calculates optimal heating times from historical records instead of small adjustments
- **Similarity-Based Learning**: Finds records with similar conditions (±2°C temperature, ±3 minutes duration)
- **Perfect Score Handling**: Intelligently weights satisfaction=50 results while applying decay for contradicted data
- **Weighted Learning**: Considers recency (2x weight), similarity, and frequency of feedback
- **Granular Feedback**: 1-100 satisfaction scale (50 = perfect) for precise learning

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean Vue 3 frontend with responsive design
- **Real-time Learning**: Immediate feedback integration for faster convergence
- **Historical Analysis**: Comprehensive data visualization with satisfaction tracking
- **Data Export**: CSV export functionality for external analysis
- **Smart Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Vue 3)
- **Framework**: Vue 3 with Options API for maintainability
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: SCSS with modern CSS features and responsive design
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with comprehensive error handling
- **State Management**: Component-based with event-driven communication

### Backend (Go)
- **Framework**: Gin for high-performance HTTP routing
- **Database**: SQLite with GORM ORM for data persistence
- **Architecture**: Clean separation with services, handlers, and models
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation with proper error responses
- **CORS**: Configured for seamless frontend integration
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration system with .env support

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

The backend uses a comprehensive environment configuration system that supports:

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Copy example configuration
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env

# Or use the setup script
cd backend && ./scripts/env-setup.sh
```

### Key Configuration Areas
- **Server**: Port, host, and CORS settings
- **Database**: Path and driver configuration
- **Prediction**: ML service version and model paths
- **Logging**: Log level and format settings
- **Environment**: Development/production mode switching

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Server
SERVER_PORT=8080
SERVER_HOST=localhost

# Database
DATABASE_PATH=./data.db
DATABASE_DRIVER=sqlite

# Prediction Service
PREDICTOR_VERSION=v2

# Environment
ENVIRONMENT=development
GIN_MODE=debug
```

See `backend/ENVIRONMENT.md` for complete documentation.

## 📊 Machine Learning Algorithm

### Core Learning Logic
The system implements a sophisticated **Target-Based Prediction** model:

```go
// For each similar historical record:
if satisfaction < 50 {
    // User was cold - calculate target time
    coldnessFactor := (50.0 - satisfaction) / 49.0
    adjustment := coldnessFactor * 4.0
    targetTime := record.HeatingTime + adjustment
} else if satisfaction > 50 {
    // User was hot - calculate target time
    hotnessFactor := (satisfaction - 50.0) / 50.0
    adjustment := -hotnessFactor * 4.0
    targetTime := record.HeatingTime + adjustment
}

// Final prediction = weighted average of all target times
```

### Perfect Score Intelligence
- **Attraction**: Satisfaction=50 results get extra weight to attract predictions
- **Decay**: Contradicted perfect scores lose influence based on newer feedback
- **Formula**: `decayFactor = 0.5 - (satisfactionDrop/100.0) - (attemptCount * 0.1)`

## 🚀 Development Process

### Built with Cursor under Strict Supervision

This project was developed using **Cursor IDE** with careful, step-by-step implementation to ensure code quality and maintainability. The development process involved:

- **Incremental Development**: Each feature was implemented and tested before moving to the next
- **Algorithm Refinement**: The ML algorithm evolved through multiple iterations based on testing
- **File Protection**: Strict protocols prevent accidental file deletions or data loss
- **Testing Integration**: Continuous testing throughout development to ensure reliability

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start development environment
./run-dev.sh
```
