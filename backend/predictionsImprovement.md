### Introduction
This document outlines the improvements made to the heating time prediction model. The primary goals achieved are:
1.  âœ… **COMPLETED**: Made prediction adjustments more sensitive to user feedback, scaling the correction based on how far the feedback is from a perfect score.
2.  âœ… **COMPLETED**: Created a hybrid model that leverages both user-specific history and global data from all users. This provides better predictions for new users and improves accuracy for existing ones.

## Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETED
All planned improvements have been successfully implemented and tested. The system now provides personalized, adaptive predictions that learn from individual user feedback while maintaining good performance for new users.

### Step 1: Introduce User Identification âœ… COMPLETED

âœ… **Successfully implemented user identification system**

*   **Task 1.1: Update Data Model & Database** âœ… COMPLETED
    *   âœ… Added `UserID` field to `models.DailyRecord` struct with proper GORM tags
    *   âœ… Updated database schema with automatic migration for existing records
    *   âœ… Added database index on `user_id` for performance
    *   âœ… Implemented migration function to set existing records to 'global' user

*   **Task 1.2: Update API Endpoints** âœ… COMPLETED
    *   âœ… Modified prediction endpoint (`/calculate`) to require `UserID` in request body
    *   âœ… Modified feedback endpoint (`/feedback`) to require `UserID` when submitting records
    *   âœ… Added proper validation for UserID field
    *   âœ… Enhanced error handling with specific error messages

*   **Task 1.3: Update Services** âœ… COMPLETED
    *   âœ… Updated `recordService.CreateRecord` to save UserID
    *   âœ… Added `GetRecordsForPredictionByUser()` for user-specific data
    *   âœ… Added `GetGlobalRecordsForPrediction()` for global data excluding specific user
    *   âœ… Created `RecordServiceInterface` for better testability

### Step 2: Refine Feedback-Based Prediction Adjustment âœ… COMPLETED

âœ… **Successfully implemented proportional and non-linear feedback adjustments**

*   **Task 2.1: Implement Relative Adjustment** âœ… COMPLETED
    *   âœ… Changed satisfaction adjustment to be **percentage-based** (up to 25% of heating time)
    *   âœ… Replaced fixed adjustments (`Â±4.0 minutes`) with relative adjustments
    *   âœ… Short heating times get smaller absolute adjustments, long heating times get larger adjustments
    *   âœ… Example: 5-minute heating â†’ max Â±1.25min adjustment, 20-minute heating â†’ max Â±5min adjustment

*   **Task 2.2: Implement Non-Linear Curve** âœ… COMPLETED
    *   âœ… Applied `math.Pow(factor, 1.5)` for more aggressive adjustments when satisfaction is far from perfect
    *   âœ… Users with satisfaction scores of 10-20 or 80-90 get more significant corrections
    *   âœ… Users with satisfaction scores near 50 get minimal adjustments

### Step 3: Implement Hybrid User/Global Prediction Model âœ… COMPLETED

âœ… **Successfully implemented intelligent hybrid prediction system**

*   **Task 3.1: Separate User and Global Data Fetching** âœ… COMPLETED
    *   âœ… Implemented separate data fetching for user-specific and global records
    *   âœ… Global records exclude the current user to avoid data duplication
    *   âœ… Both queries are optimized with proper indexing

*   **Task 3.2: Calculate User-Specific and Global Predictions** âœ… COMPLETED
    *   âœ… Created `calculatePredictionFromRecords()` as reusable prediction function
    *   âœ… Implemented `getCombinedPrediction()` to orchestrate hybrid logic
    *   âœ… System calculates both user and global predictions independently

*   **Task 3.3: Combine Predictions with Weighted Average** âœ… COMPLETED
    *   âœ… Implemented weighted average: `finalPrediction = (userPrediction * userWeight) + (globalPrediction * globalWeight)`
    *   âœ… Created `calculateUserWeight()` function based on relevant records count
    *   âœ… User weight formula: `min(1.0, relevantRecords / 10.0)` - reaches full personalization after 10 similar records
    *   âœ… Global weight automatically calculated as `1.0 - userWeight`

*   **Task 3.4: Handle New Users** âœ… COMPLETED
    *   âœ… New users with no history get `userWeight = 0` (100% global predictions)
    *   âœ… Solves "cold start" problem with sensible defaults from global data
    *   âœ… Smooth transition from global to personalized predictions as user provides feedback

### Step 4: Refactor and Test âœ… COMPLETED

âœ… **Successfully refactored and thoroughly tested the system**

*   **Task 4.1: Refactor `PredictionService`** âœ… COMPLETED
    *   âœ… Broke down complex logic into well-named functions:
        *   `getCombinedPrediction()` - main hybrid logic orchestrator
        *   `calculatePredictionFromRecords()` - reusable prediction calculator
        *   `calculateUserWeight()` - determines personalization level
    *   âœ… Created `RecordServiceInterface` for better dependency injection and testing
    *   âœ… Maintained clean separation of concerns

*   **Task 4.2: Add Unit Tests** âœ… COMPLETED
    *   âœ… Created comprehensive test suite in `prediction_service_test.go`
    *   âœ… **Test Case 1:** New user receives purely global prediction âœ… PASSING
    *   âœ… **Test Case 2:** User with few records receives blended prediction âœ… PASSING
    *   âœ… **Test Case 3:** User with many records receives user-based prediction âœ… PASSING
    *   âœ… **Test Case 4:** Relative feedback adjustment works correctly âœ… PASSING
    *   âœ… **Test Case 5:** User weight calculation scales properly âœ… PASSING
    *   âœ… All tests use proper mocking for isolated unit testing

## Frontend Integration âœ… COMPLETED

âœ… **Successfully updated frontend to work with new user-based system**

*   âœ… Added User ID input field with localStorage persistence
*   âœ… Updated API calls to include `userId` parameter
*   âœ… Enhanced error handling with specific backend error messages
*   âœ… Removed unused UUID dependency from frontend
*   âœ… Implemented user-friendly interface with helpful placeholders
